# tindie-api-arduino
An Arduino library that wraps the Tindie.com API

Tested on the ESP8266, but should work on any device that supports https requests (ESP32 etc)

Check out the provided examples for how to use it.

## Please Note!

Use the latest released version of the ESP8266 core (v2.5 RC2) to use the fingerprint verify as shown in the examples. If someone gets access to your Tindie API key they could retrieve personal info on all your customers!
